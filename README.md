# Kubernetes Semantic Image Controller

This is a Kubernetes Mutating Webhook Controller developed as part of the [Rawkode Live Episode on 
Writing a Kubernetes Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLpzsAQtZ7M)

This is mostly prototyping code developed and tested against Kubernetes 1.20. It may not be quite ready for
production usage. Use at your own risk!
